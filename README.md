When the user first starts the extension, it by default blocks the major social media websites i.e Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram. If the user wants to block more websites to be productive, the user can change the blocked list through the __Settings__ page! The user also can add more websites for the extension to block and can also remove websites from the list! <br />

When the user goes to a page that should be blocked. The active tab redirects them to the __blocked page__. It basically only shows that the page is blocked and the user can just go back to the last page. <br />
